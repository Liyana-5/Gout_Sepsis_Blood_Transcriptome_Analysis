## Overview 

This repository contains an R-based transcriptomic analysis exploring gene expression differences in blood samples from patients with gout and sepsis.
The aim of this study is to uncover molecular distinctions between these two inflammatory diseases, identify disease-specific biomarkers.
Different statistical tests are used to answer hypothesis. (Chi-square,t-test,regression (GLm models), ANOVA)

## Hypothesis
Although both gout and sepsis involve systemic inflammation, the underlying transcriptional programs differ in immune regulation, cytokine signaling and metabolic pathways.
We hypothesize that distinct gene expression signatures in blood can effectively differentiate gout from sepsis, reflecting disease-specific immune activation patterns.
